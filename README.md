# 📊 NSE Sector Dashboard

## 🔎 Overview
This project is a **fully interactive data analytics dashboard** that provides sector-wise insights on the **Indian stock market (NSE)**. The tool merges real-time technical data with financial news sentiment analysis to help traders, analysts, and investors:

- Identify **top-performing and underperforming sectors**
- Gauge **market mood and sectoral sentiment** using NLP
- Use **relative strength** for actionable trade insights
- Build a **foundation for machine learning trend prediction**

Unlike basic price trackers, this dashboard provides a **360° view** of sector dynamics by combining:
- 📈 **Price Action and Momentum**
- 🌐 **News-Based Sentiment (India + Global)**
- 🧠 **Relative Strength vs NIFTY**
- 🚀 **Scalable ML-ready architecture**

---

## 🧠 Methodology & Approaches

### 1. **Technical Price-Based Movement Analysis**
We collect **daily price data** for major NSE sector indices using `yfinance`. Each sector’s daily momentum is computed using:

```math
% Change = ((Close_Today - Close_Yesterday) / Close_Yesterday) * 100
```

This identifies **momentum leaders and laggards**.

---

### 2. **Relative Strength (RS) Analysis vs NIFTY 50**
A core innovation in this project is **RS scoring**, which identifies outperforming sectors based on:

```math
RS Score = Sector % Change - NIFTY % Change
```

#### 🔮 Prediction Mapping
- RS > +0.5 → 🚀 **Strong Buy Watch**
- RS between -0.5 to +0.5 → ⚠️ **Weak/Neutral**
- RS < -0.5 → 🔻 **Underperforming Sector**

This is used for **next-session predictions**, especially useful for **short-term traders and swing setups**.

### 3. **FinBERT-Based Sentiment Analysis**
We integrate **FinBERT**, a transformer model trained on financial texts, to score news articles:

#### 🧠 Formula:
```math
Sentiment Score = P(Positive) - P(Negative)
```

We analyze articles from:
- 🇮🇳 Indian business sources (e.g., MoneyControl, ET)
- 🌍 Global financial media (via NewsAPI)

Each sector receives a **blended sentiment score**:

```math
Final Score = 0.6 × India_Sentiment + 0.4 × Global_Sentiment
```

Then categorized into:
- 😃 Bullish
- 😐 Neutral
- 😟 Bearish

This method lets us quantify **narrative-based sentiment impact** on different sectors.
